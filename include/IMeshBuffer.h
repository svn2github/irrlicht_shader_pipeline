	//! Struct for holding a mesh with a single material.
	/** A part of an IMesh which has the same material on each face of that
	group. Logical groups of an IMesh need not be put into separate mesh
	buffers, but can be. Separately animated parts of the mesh must be put
	into separate mesh buffers.
	Some mesh buffer implementations have limitations on the number of
	vertices the buffer can hold. In that case, logical grouping can help.
	Moreover, the number of vertices should be optimized for the GPU upload,
	which often depends on the type of gfx card. Typial figures are
	1000-10000 vertices per buffer.
	SMeshBuffer is a simple implementation of a MeshBuffer, which supports
	up to 65535 vertices.

	Since meshbuffers are used for drawing, and hence will be exposed
	to the driver, chances are high that they are grab()'ed from somewhere.
	It's therefore required to dynamically allocate meshbuffers which are
	passed to a video driver and only drop the buffer once it's not used in
	the current code block anymore.
